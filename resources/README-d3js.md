D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) is a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in web browsers. Some of the most commonly used D3 charts are:

1. **Bar Chart**:
   - **Vertical Bar Chart**: Represents data with vertical bars, where the length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents.
   - **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Similar to a vertical bar chart, but with horizontal bars.

2. **Line Chart**:
   - Used to display data points connected by straight lines. Commonly used to show trends over time.

3. **Pie Chart**:
   - Circular chart divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions.

4. **Scatter Plot**:
   - Displays values for typically two variables for a set of data. Each point represents an observation.

5. **Area Chart**:
   - Similar to a line chart but with the area below the line filled with color.

6. **Donut Chart**:
   - A variation of the pie chart with a hole in the center, used to represent proportions.

7. **Bubble Chart**:
   - A variation of a scatter plot where each point is replaced with a bubble, and the size of the bubble represents an additional variable.

8. **Heatmap**:
   - Represents data values as colors in a grid. Commonly used to show correlations between two variables.

9. **Tree Map**:
   - Displays hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles.

10. **Chord Diagram**:
   - Used to show relationships between different data points, with arcs connecting points.

11. **Force-Directed Graph**:
   - A type of network graph where nodes are arranged based on their connections.

12. **Histogram**:
   - Represents the distribution of data by dividing it into bins and displaying the frequency of each bin.

13. **Box Plot**:
   - Used to represent the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

14. **Radar Chart (Spider Chart)**:
   - Displays multivariate data in a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point.

15. **Sankey Diagram**:
   - Visualizes the flow of quantities between different stages or categories.

These charts are versatile and can be customized extensively using D3.js to fit various data visualization needs.
